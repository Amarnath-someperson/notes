Transition elements show similar properties in both periods and groups, due to similarity in valence configuration.

Zn, Cd and Hg are not regarded as transition elements as their orbitals are completely filled.

# transition metal properties

> To show transitional properties, the _d_-block elements have incompletely filled _d_-orbital in the ground state **OR** in oxidised state.

Ions of a given $d^{1-9}$ configuration commonly show

1. similar magnetic and electric properties
2. variable oxidation states
3. colour
4. complex formation
5. catalytic property
6. paramagnetic behaviour

General physical properties of $d$-block

1. metallic properties
    1. high tensile strength
    2. ductility
    3. malleability
    4. high thermal and electric conductivity
    5. lustre
2. hardness
3. less volatile
4. high melting and boiling point
5. high enthalpy of atomisation
6. high density

except Zn, Cd and Hg due to their low mp, bp, $\Delta_{\text{atom}}H$, volatility. They are not regarded as transition metals as above.

The other transition elements show these properties as they have strong metallic bond.

## metallic bond association

Metallic bonding,

1. $ns$ electrons and $(n-1)d$ **unpaired** electrons participate in metallic bonding.
2. The superior metallic properties with respect to the $s$ block elements are due to involvement of $d$ unpaired electrons in metallic bonding.
3. As the number of unpaired electrons increases, the metallic bond strength increases.

Metallic bond across the period

1. number of unpaired electrons increases upto the middle and then it decreases, same for metallic bond.
2. Mn, Tc etc have abnormally less bonding strength / extent of association due to their smaller size and increased nuclear repulsion.
3. Zn, Cd, Hg have weakest metallic bonding in their series (fully filled $d$ orbital).

Metallic bond **down the group increases**.

Melting and boiling points of transition metals are directly related with metallic bond association (across the period, increases then decreases, down the group increases).

In the last series, there is no abnormality as the size of the atoms of  elements are really large.

## enthalpy of atomisation

Enthalpy of atomisation

1. $\Delta_a H$ is very high.
2. Along a series, it first increases then decreases.
3. Mn and Tc have abnormally low $\Delta_a H$

You may realise that this is very similar to the metallic bond strength. This is because it depends on the same.

## density

The same for density. $\rho=m/V$, here across the period, mass increases, and atomic volume decreases, therefore there is generally an increase in density. Down the group as well density increases. Zn shows abnormal value even though until Ni and Cu the density increases, this is due to its _abnormally large size (volume)_.

Most dense metal in $d$-block is Os ($22.6 ~\mathrm{g~cm}^{-3}$). The lowest is Sc ($3.1 ~\mathrm{g~cm}^{-3}$).

## atomic size

Atomic and ionic size generally decreases from left to right upto the middle, then there is only a small decrease between elements, and then a slight increase. This is because, as electrons are added to the inner shells ($d$-subshells), there is an increase in shielding effect which opposes the effect due to nuclear charge. For $Z_\text{eff}=Z-\sigma$, where $Z$ is the nuclear charge, $\sigma$ is the shielding effect, and $Z_\text{eff}$ is the effective nuclear charge.

Down the group, size increases.

But, the atomic sizes of $4d\approx 5d$. In the 3rd transition series ($5d$), the filling of $4f$ before $5d$ results in regular decrease in atomic radii. This is an after effect of **lanthanoid contraction**.

**The elements from 58-71 and 90-103 are not $d$-block elements.** They are $f$-block elements. $f$-electrons show very little shielding ($s>p>d>f$). Therefore, effective nuclear charge increases, and the $5d$ series has contracted size almost equal to $4d$.

## note on exchange energy

The amount of energy released when electrons with the same spin swap positions in degenerate orbitals. **The more exchanges there are, the more exchange energy is released, and the more stable the subshell becomes.**
